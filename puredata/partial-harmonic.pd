\, starting with one., f 84;
#X text 10 130 When a parameter change is detected \, a bang is sent
to \$2-recalc. You may delay this bang to throttle the recalcs and
then send it back to the inlet of the fist harmonic. Its outlet will
bang \, when the processing is done \, so that the harmonics can just
forward the bang to each other via the outlets/inlets., f 84;
#X text 10 210 For all this to work \, the synthesizer must have loaded
the basic waveforms with the [wavetables/xx/wavetable-xx] objects.
